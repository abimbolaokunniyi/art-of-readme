PART A: What I learned from the original README article
 A readme is a textfile that explains what a project does, how to use it and other important information about the project
 A readme should do the following tell what the project is ,show what it looks like in action ,explain how to use it and list any extra important details (installation, license, etc.)
 The sequence in which a readme should come called cognitive funneling is that it should have an overview, how it is used and then the technical stuffs or codes that runs the software
